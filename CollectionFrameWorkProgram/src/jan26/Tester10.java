/*
 * Program: 10
Three classes are given to you :-
A java class Employee is given to you with some properties & their accessor and mutator
methods.
Another class named EmployeeSorter is also given in which you need to write the code for
sorting Employee class objects based on firstName property of the Employee class
in ascending order. Make sure that EmployeeSorter sorts only class Employee objects and if
other class object is passed then it must not include it in sorting.
A class Testing is also given in which there are 5 objects of class Employee created where every
object holds a unique employee data. All the employee objects are added in the TreeSet which
will sort them based on the sorting algorithm you provide in class EmployeeSorter.
NOTE:
class Employee must not be edited.
For Testing your algorithm, just edit and run the Testing class.
